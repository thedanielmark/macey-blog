                                We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that
                                you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for
                                customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information,
                                but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our
                                secured payment gateways).

                                When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic

                                features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and
                                services and to drive new product development.

                                through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your
                                contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you
                                made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting,
                                retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and
                                profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from
                                the social media site.

                                This Privacy Policy statement is made by MixSpace consisting of all the entities
                                listed here (collectively, "MixSpace", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 9th May
                                2020. It applies to all our divisions: MixSpace, xPort Engine and Mer Mobile.

                            <h4 class="font-weight-bold mt-5">MixSpace’s Privacy Commitment</h4>
                            <p class="custom-para text-justify mt-4">
                                The creators of MixSpace have worried about customer and user privacy for years, long
                                before it
                                became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We
                                ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe
                                is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let
                                customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific
                                engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar
                                from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our
                                products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering
                                customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in
                                customer privacy that it brings.
                            </p>

                            <p class="custom-para text-justify mt-4">
                                The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers
                                and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer
                                than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will
                                try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
                            </p>

                                Some internet browsers have enabled 'Do Not Track' (DNT) features, which send out a

                                wish to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard that governs what websites can or
                                should do when they receive these signals. For now, we do not take action in response to
