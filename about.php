                                Hi! My name is <a href="https://danielmarkd.com">Daniel Mark</a> and I created MixSpace. There's a couple of reasons why I
                                created MixSpace. Scroll down and read 'em if you're interested!

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mt-5">Bigger Tech Companies</h4>
                                <p class="mt-4 custom-para text-justify">
                                    One of the biggest reasons why I wanted to build a service like MixSpace is that
                                    huge cloud service providers such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS tend to rip people
                                    off through their overly complicated applications that contain many features that
                                    the average developer might not even need.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-4 custom-para text-justify">
                                    These companies have obscure billing systems that charge you for stuff you never
                                    knew you were using. Moreover, when you go to bigger web hosts such as GoDaddy and
                                    Rackspace, they tie you to a one year plan at exhorbitant rates which won't be
                                    refunded should you cancel your subscription at any point in time.
                                </p>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mt-5">The Learning Curve</h4>
                                <p class="mt-4 custom-para text-justify">
                                    I still remember the first time I tried using Google Cloud Platform. It took me days
                                    to figure out how to configure certain services or applications and this was largely
                                    due to the lack of proper documentation.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-4 custom-para text-justify">
                                    Most developers who are new to the web hosting or cloud computing environment look
                                    for services that are simple and easy to use. GCP and AWS are good for huge
                                    applications that need to scale both horizontally and vertically in a short period
                                    of time but the amount of prep work that has to go into setting up your projects on
                                    each platform is way too much.
                                </p>

                                    Let's assume you aren't a developer or you're just starting out and don't know
                                    anything about computers but want to host your own site. MixSpace was designed
                                    keeping people like you in mind. I want to be able to show people that programming
                                    is for everyone and all it takes is a little motivation and the will to learn to
                                    start working on your personal projects!
                                </p>

                                    Personally, the whole idea of building something like a cloud computing service is
                                    daunting and fun at the same time. It's a steep learning curve specially because of
                                    the plethora of new tools and technologies being created every single day in the
                                    tech industry.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-4 custom-para text-justify">
                                    It isn't humanly possible to keep up with every framework or language that is
                                    released and it always feels like I've just started out. By building a service like
                                    MixSpace, I hope to teach myself more of DevOps, distributed & parallel computing as
                                    well as cloud computing.
                                </p>

                                    P.S. I know this service is still far from becoming a full fledged cloud service
                                    provider but I hope the stuff we've built so far will benefit at least some of you
                                    as much as this has been a learning experience for me!
